# SubtractSquare
CSCB58 Final Project

SubtractSquare is a two-player strategy game. A positive whole number is randomly generated as the starting value. The player whose turn it is chooses some square of a positive whole number (such as 1, 4, 9, 16 , ...) to subtract from the value, provided the chosen square is not larger. After subtracting, we have a new value and the next player chooses a square to subtract from it. The game play continues to alternate between the two players until no moves are possible. Whoever is about to play at that point loses!


Game instructions are provided by Professors Danny Heap and Diane Horton.
